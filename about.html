              <h3>Who The Hell Does Ty Gerhardt Think He Is?</h3>
              I'm Ty Gerhardt. I'm a Junior Front-End Developer, Digital Producer, Project Management Professional, Certified Scrum Master, and Copy Writer with 20+ years of cumulative working experience living in the Portland, OR area. I have proven expertise in planning and executing large, complex digital projects. I am a strategic and a forward planner who possess a fundamental grasp of contemporary project management methodologies and frameworks utilized in the digital space. I am a collaborative team player & creative thinker who possesses strong written & verbal communication skills.
              <br>
              <br>
              Ever since being invited to participate in the G.A.T.E. program in 8th grade where I learned how to program in BASIC I have had a passion for technology but my love of art, design, and music along with a deeply held philosophy of continuous learning has helped make me a strong technical and creative asset to any team undertaking digital transformation or new development projects.
              <br>
              <br>
              Currently I am a Senior Project Management Analyst at Comscore and I'm participating in University of Oregon's Full Stack Development Bootcamp (graduating in October of 2020).
