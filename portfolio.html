        <p style="width: auto;"><br>The <a href="https://tygerhardt.github.io/Homework_Week_6/" target="blank">Weather Dashboard</a> was one of our first assignments that we leveraged API's build a tool allows you to search for and return specific data. It was a bit challenging but mostly fun and a great introduction to using API's.</p>

        <p style="width: auto;"><br>Do you love Spotify? Do you like the idea of being able to create playlists based on the weather in your home town or exotic location...AUTOMAGICALLY?!!! Of course you do...and that's what we did. 
          <br>
          <br>
          <a href="https://weerklank.github.io/HyperSlugs/" target="blank">TŪNADO!</a> was a collaborative effort and my very first coding bootcamp group project. This app succesfully leveraged Spotify and weather API's to create this cool and fun app. My primary focus was on the HTML and CSS as well as the name and overall look and feel. I was looking to create a clean, minimalist, late-70's early 80's aesthetic as a fun alternative to all of the Bootstrappy sites out there. In fact, for CSS we opted to use Skeleton CSS for it's ease of use and customization.  </p>
